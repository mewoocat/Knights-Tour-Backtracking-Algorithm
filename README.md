# Knights-Tour-Backtracking-Algorithm

Solution to the Knight's Tour problem for n x n grid

Function:
        This program is backtracking solution to the Knight's Tour problem for n x n grid.
        Program takes input for grid size and starting position on the grid.
        The backtracking algorithm searches down each possible solution path until a solution is found.
        If a solution is not found then the function returns false.

Use:
    Download knights.py
    Ensure Python 3 is installed
    Run knights.py vis python 3
    Follow terminal prompts and if a solution is found then it will be printed to the screen

Algorithm Implemented:
    The algorithm method used in this program is known as backtracking.
    Here backtracking is implemented recusivley by travsing each possible solution path until found to be invalid.
    The program backtracks to the previous position and continues to try each possible move
